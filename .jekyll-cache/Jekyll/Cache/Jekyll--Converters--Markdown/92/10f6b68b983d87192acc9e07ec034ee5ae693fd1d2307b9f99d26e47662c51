<p><span class="newthought">This photographic long-term project</span> documents the retreat of human presence from remote rural areas in the Alps. It studies the human/ non-human relationship in a landscape shaped by human labour  for centuries. With a particular focus on the remains of non-agricultural activities, the project examines through image and text how various industries â€“ and not only agriculture â€“ have transformed these remote areas.
<br />
<span class="newthought">The pictures below</span> explore the artifacts in an abandoned quarry in the Ossola Valley in Northern Piedmont, Italy. The tools, machines, hoses, and ropes bear witness to human labour that shaped the landscape for centuries. The quarried granit blocks and the bare rocks show the scars of extraction.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Forestry, hydropower, and quarries</span> are characterstics for the Ossola Valley in Northern Piedmont (Italy), which is a main focus of this project. In the 20th Century â€“ in particular after World War II and until the late 1980s â€“ large industrial steelwork complexes and the chemical industry provided jobs for those who gave up agriculture. As a result, inhabitants abandoned the more remote hamlets, and the forest reclaimed the terraced pastures, vineyards, and chestnut groves over the years.</p>
