<p><span class="newthought">Forestry, hydropower, and quarries</span> are characterstic for the Ossola Valley in Northern Piedmont (Italy), which is a main focus of this project. In the 20th Century – in particular after World War II and until the late 1980ies – large industrial steelwork complexes and the chemical industry provided jobs for those who gave up agriculture.
