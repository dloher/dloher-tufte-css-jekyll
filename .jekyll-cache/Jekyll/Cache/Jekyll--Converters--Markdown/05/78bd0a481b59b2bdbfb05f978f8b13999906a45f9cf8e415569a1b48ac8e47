I"T<p>This photographic long-term project documents the retreat of the human presence from remote rural areas in the Alps. It studies the human/ non-human relationship in a landscape shaped by human labour  for centuries. With a particular focus on the remains of non-agricultural activities, the project examines through image and text how various industries – and not only agriculture – have transformed these remote areas.</p>

<p>Forestry, hydropower, and quarries are characterstic for the Ossola Valley in Northern Piedmont (Italy), which is a main focus of this project. In the 20th Century – in particular after World War II and until the late 1980ies – large industrial stellwork complexes and the chemical industry provided jobs for those who gave up agriculture. As a result, inhabitants abandened the more remote hamlets, the forst reclaimed the terraced pastures, vineyards, and chestnut groves over the years.
Simultaneously, these abandoned spaces offer new opportunities. Especially since the global financial crisis in 2008,</p>
