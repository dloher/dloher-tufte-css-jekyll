<p><label for="profile" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="profile" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/assets/img/profile.png" /><br />As a social anthropologist, I am an expert in “deep hanging out” (Rosaldo). Curious to know more about the social world, I consider iterative research designs as a productive way to leave space for the unexpected.
<br />Others call it the principle of serendipity.</span></p>

<p><span class="newthought">I</span> am a social anthropologist and a specialist in higher education development based in Switzerland. As an anthropologist, I am interested in questions at the intersections of legal anthropology, environmental anthropology, and the anthropology of the state. As a higher education development specialist, I am working on questions of public education. Intrigued by the idea of the university not only as a space for individual learning, but as a public and cultural institution, I am interested in creating learning environments that foster critical thinking and collaboration, and hold dear the idea of human freedom as a basic idea of pedagogy.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">I</span> received my PhD in social anthropology from the <a href="https://www.anthro.unibe.ch" target="blank">University of Bern</a> in 2016 with a research on so-called assisted voluntary return migration, tracing the transnational migration trajectories of Tunisian migrants between Tunisia and Switzerland. In my following project as a Post-doc researcher, I was working on the legacy of the asbestos industry in Northern Italy. Since 2021, I am a higher education development specialist at the <a href="https://www.hslu.ch/zllf" target="blank">Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and the Arts HSLU</a>.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">In</span> addition to my expertise in ethnographic research methods, mixed methods research designs, and my knowledge in anthropological theories, I have extensive teaching experience at universities and universities of applied sciences, and a background as an elementary school teacher.</p>
