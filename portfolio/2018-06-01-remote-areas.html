<p><span class="newthought">This photographic long-term project</span> documents the retreat of human presence from remote rural areas in the Alps. It studies the human/ non-human relationship in a landscape shaped by human labour  for centuries. With a particular focus on the remains of non-agricultural activities, the project examines through image and text how various industries – and not only agriculture – have transformed these remote areas.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">In the following picture,</span> tools, machines, hoses, and ropes bear witness to human labour that shaped the landscape for centuries in an abandoned quarry in the Ossola Valley in Northern Piedmont (Italy). Scars of extraction of natural resources mark the quarried granite blocks and the bare rock alike.</p>
