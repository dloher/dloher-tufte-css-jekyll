This photographic long-term project documents the retreat of the human presence from remote rural areas in the Alps. It studies the human/ non-human relationship in a landscape shaped by human labour  for centuries. With a particular focus on the remains of non-agricultural activities, the project examines through image and text how various industries – and not only agriculture – have transformed these remote areas.

Forestry, hydropower, and quarries are characterstic for the Ossola Valley in Northern Piedmont (Italy), which is a main focus of this project. In the 20th Century – in particular after World War II and until the late 1980ies – large industrial stellwork complexes and the chemical industry provided jobs for those who gave up agriculture. As a result, inhabitants abandened the more remote hamlets, and the forest reclaimed the terraced pastures, vineyards, and chestnut groves over the years.
