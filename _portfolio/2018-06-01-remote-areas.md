{%newthought 'This photographic long-term project' %} documents the retreat of human presence from remote rural areas in the Alps. It studies the human/ non-human relationship in a landscape shaped by human labour  for centuries. With a particular focus on the remains of non-agricultural activities, the project examines through image and text how various industries – and not only agriculture – have transformed these remote areas.

{%newthought 'In the following picture,' %} tools, machines, hoses, and ropes bear witness to human labour that shaped the landscape for centuries in an abandoned quarry in the Ossola Valley in Northern Piedmont (Italy). Scars of extraction of natural resources mark the quarried granite blocks and the bare rock alike.

In the 20th Century – in particular after World War II and until the late 1980s – large industrial steelwork complexes and the chemical industry provided jobs for those who gave up agriculture. As a result, inhabitants abandoned the more remote hamlets, and the forest reclaimed the terraced pastures, vineyards, and chestnut groves over the years.

{%newthought 'Simultaneously, the vacated' %} spaces allow for new – experimental – forms of exploitation and cohabitation. This re-appropriation by newcomers has quite a long tradition in many remote areas of the Alps and typically occurs in cycles.
